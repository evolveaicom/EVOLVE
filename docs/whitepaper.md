# EVOLVE Protocol: A Self-Evolving Meme Token Ecosystem
## Technical Whitepaper v1.0

## Abstract
EVOLVE Protocol introduces a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency by implementing true evolutionary mechanics in token economics. Through AI-driven mutation and community-governed natural selection, EVOLVE creates the first genuinely adaptive digital asset that responds to market conditions and community sentiment in real-time.
