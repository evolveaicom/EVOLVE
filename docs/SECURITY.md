# EVOLVE Protocol Security Model

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the EVOLVE Protocol to protect user assets and ensure system integrity.

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
```solidity
modifier onlyGovernance {
    require(msg.sender == governance, "Not authorized");
    _;
}

modifier timelocked {
    require(block.timestamp >= lastActionTime + TIMELOCK_PERIOD, "Time locked");
    _;
}
```

### Multi-signature Implementation
- 3/5 Multi-signature requirement for critical functions
- Distributed key management
- Time-locked execution

### Emergency Controls
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Emergency pause functionality
- Gradual parameter updates

## Evolution Security

### Mutation Controls
- Rate limiting on mutations
- Bounded parameter ranges
- Genetic validation checks
- Anti-exploitation measures

### Voting Security
- Token-weighted voting
- Delegation controls
- Vote locking mechanism
- Sybil resistance

## AI Engine Security

### Input Validation
- Data sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Access control
- Error handling

### Model Security
- Secure model updates
- Version control
- Fallback mechanisms
- Performance monitoring

## Network Security

### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Input validation
- CORS policies

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Secure transmission
- Access logging
- Regular backups

## Operational Security

### Deployment Process
